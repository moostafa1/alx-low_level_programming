0-putchar.c --> prints _putchar, followed by a new line


1-alphabet.c --> prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line {Prototype: void print_alphabet(void); -- You can only use _putchar twice in your code}


2-print_alphabet_x10.c --> prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line {Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void); -- You can only use _putchar twice in your code}


3-islower.c --> function that checks for lowercase character {Prototype: int _islower(int c); -- Returns 1 if c is lowercase -- Returns 0 otherwise}


4-isalpha.c --> function that checks for alphabetic character {Prototype: int _isalpha(int c); -- Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase -- Returns 0 otherwise}


5-sign.c --> function that prints the sign of a number {Prototype: int print_sign(int n); -- Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero -- Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero -- Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero}




6-abs.c --> computes the absolute value of an integer


7-print_last_digit.c --> prints the last digit of a number


8-24_hours.c --> prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59


9-times_table.c --> prints the 9 times table, starting with 0


10-add.c --> adds two integers and returns the result



11-print_to_98.c --> prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line {Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space -- Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space -- The first printed number should be the number passed to your function -- The last printed number should be 98 -- You are allowed to use the standard library -- Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);}


100-times_table.c --> function that prints the n times table, starting with 0 {If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything}


101-natural.c --> computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line
