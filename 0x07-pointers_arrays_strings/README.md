2-strchr.c --> function that locates a character in a string {Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found}


3-strspn.c --> function that gets the length of a prefix substring {Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept}

4-strpbrk.c --> function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes {Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found}


5-strstr.c --> function that locates a substring {Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found}
